# Libtorch and Opencv

A minimal example of how ot use OpenCV and Libtorch in the same project.

The project expects Libtorch/ in the top-level direcotry. I have not included this in the repository to keep it light. 

```bash
wget https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/nightly/cpu/libtorch-shared-with-deps-latest.zip
unzip libtorch-shared-with-deps-latest.zip
```

For first time install, check this https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html
